- Congressional districts are labeled with id attributes in SVG for interactive purposes.
- North is tilted to align the Central Mountain Range to the 45-deg diagonal.
-- As a result, all lines are straight, horizontal, or 45-deg. Awesome.
- City and county borders are marked with thick strokes. Congressional districts with thin strokes.
- Off-shore islands are marked with thin strokes to avoid clutter.
