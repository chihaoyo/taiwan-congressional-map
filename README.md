- Congressional districts are labeled with id attributes in SVG for interactive purposes.
- North is tilted to align the Central Mountain Range to the 45-deg diagonal. This way,
  - Hualian’s outline is minimal,
  - many other cities and counties’ outlines are a lot more elegant,
  - and all lines are kept straight, horizontal, or 45-deg.
  - Awesome.
- City and county borders are marked with thick strokes. Congressional districts with thin strokes.
- Off-shore islands are marked with thin strokes to avoid clutter.
